### User Story

As a Music lover I would like to search for top 5 songs of an artist and then find music videos of those songs. I would also like to view the music video as long as there is a music video available online. When I search for the artist. 

### Acceptance Criteria

When user search for an artist in search bar 
Then the search result pulls up 5 songs of that artist from a music website.
Then those 5 songs are shown below the serach bar in a song playing card.
when user clicks one of the 5 song Cards
Then the program searches for videos of the song in a outside server. 
Then the video is imported in the disc-cover
Then user is directed to the music video player on the disc cover and plays the music video of the selected song.
